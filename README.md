			Introduction

	This is a web-based project to display the concepts taught in Software Methods and Tools (CSCI 3308). This specifically contains a website meant to teach high school/early college aged users basic computer science concepts, such as the if statement and variable types.

			Repo Structure

	This repo includes three folders and a bunch of freefloating files. All files with the message "Final project as of 5/5" or "changing things back" are files involved in the actual website and its source files. Everything else are files we made to serve database functions or basic original website documents before we began using WordPress.

			How to use
	
	As of this point, there is nothing that needs to be run directly, as such is already being run on a wordpress server and shared on Google's cloud for public use. Go to http://35.193.179.154/  for site usage.
